# BMP to TGA Format Converter App
This is a small program I wrote on my Raspberry Pi 3 for converting Microsoft's BMP image format to the open TGA format.

I wrote this as a small project that I started in order to try and learn how binary file formats work. BMP and TGA are fairly simple image formats and they allowed me to understand the internals of each binary image format, with the help of various specifications I found online for the two.
